# 1. ngrx Reducer

Let's test the reducer. Very easy actually.

**holidays/+state/holidays.reducer.spec.ts**

```typescript
it('should add the holidays on findHolidaySuccess', () => {
  const holidays = [
    { id: 1, title: 'Pyramids' },
    { id: 2, title: 'Tower Bridge' }
  ] as Holiday[];

  const state = holidaysFeature.reducer(
    { holidays: [] },
    holidaysActions.findHolidaysSuccess({ holidays })
  );

  expect(state).toEqual({ holidays });
});
```

Write two other tests, one testing that the action `findHoliday` doesn't change anyhting and another that a `findHolidaySuccess` overwrites pre-existing holidays.

**holidays/+state/holidays.reducer.spec.ts**

```typescript
it('should be no state change on findHoliday', () => {
  const state = holidaysFeature.reducer({ holidays: [] }, holidaysActions.findHolidays());

  expect(state).toEqual({ holidays: [] });
});

it('should replace existing holidays on findHolidaySuccess', () => {
  const initialState = { holidays: [{ id: 1, title: 'Pyramids' }] as Holiday[] };

  const state = holidaysFeature.reducer(
    initialState,
    holidaysActions.findHolidaysSuccess({
      holidays: [{ id: 2, title: 'Tower Bridge' } as Holiday]
    })
  );

  expect(state.holidays).toEqual([{ id: 2, title: 'Tower Bridge' } as Holiday]);
});
```

# 2. ngrx Selectors

Even easier and simpler than to test the reducer.

**holidays/+state/holidays.selectors.spec.ts**

```typescript
it('should select the holidays', () => {
  const state: HolidaysState = {
    holidays: [
      { id: 1, title: 'Pyramids' },
      { id: 2, title: 'Tower Bridge' }
    ] as Holiday[]
  };

  expect(fromHolidays.get.projector(state)).toEqual([
    { id: 1, title: 'Pyramids' },
    { id: 2, title: 'Tower Bridge' }
  ] as Holiday[]);
});
```

# 3. ngrx Effect

In order to test our effects, we create a new file **holiday.effects.spec.ts**. The properties in an effect are nothing more than normal Observables and we can test also test them as we do with all others.

```typescript
it(
  'should test find$',
  marbles((m) => {
    const httpClient = {
      get: () => m.cold('---a', { a: [{ id: 1, imageUrl: '/pyramids.jpg' }] })
    };
    const actions$ = m.cold('a', { a: holidaysActions.findHolidays() });

    const effect = new HolidaysEffects(
      actions$,
      (httpClient as unknown) as HttpClient,
      'http://api.eternal-holidays.net'
    );
    m.expect(effect.find$).toBeObservable('3ms a', {
      a: holidaysActions.findHolidaysSuccess({
        holidays: [
          ({
            id: 1,
            imageUrl: 'http://api.eternal-holidays.net/pyramids.jpg'
          } as unknown) as Holiday
        ]
      })
    });
  })
);
```
